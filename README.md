<h1>Google Data Analytics Certificate Case Study: Bike Share Program</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

- For the Google Data Analytics Certificate, I chose Case Study 1 as my Capstone Project. <br />
- In brief, in this project, I was tasked as a "junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. And my team wanted to understand "how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently." From the insights gained from data analysis (including the asking, preparing, collecting, cleaning, processing, analysis, and sharing steps), my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. <br />

- There were three questions that guide the future marketing program, and I was assigned the first question to answer:<br />
<b><p align="center">"How do annual members and riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"</p></b>

- I collected (downloaded) <b>15 consecutive months</b> of data from a provided database. I used <b>Microsoft Excel</b> for the data preparation and processing (cleaning) steps.</b>

- After the "prepare" and "process" steps, I used <b>R programming (RStudio)</b> to analyze the cleaned data. </b>
- And below is the "Share" step, where I am sharing my findings represented in simple graphs and tables generated using RStudio. </b>
</b>


<h2>Data Analysis Program Used </h2>

- <b>Microsoft Excel</b>
- <b>RStudio</b>


<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

- <b>In this case study, I used 15 consecutive months of Cyclistic bike-share program data to evaluate: its bike rental performance, determine the trends of bike rentals by casual rides and members, and theorize what caused the differences in rental between the two categories of riders. I then developed an action plan based on those findings by suggesting 3 top recommendations</b>

- <b> Answers to the Question I was tasked with:
<p align="center">1) Member riders use Cyclistic bikes more frequently than Casual riders but for shorter durations on weekdays. The shorter rides by Member riders could be for daily commutes to and from work.
<p align="center">2) Casual riders had lower ride numbers but for longer durations in comparison to Member riders, especially on weekends, and they mostly used classic bikes than electric bikes.</p></b>
(The Top 3 Recommendations are listed at the end)


<h2>Findings</h2>


<b> 1) First analysis of the data: Find out the number of rides taken by Casual riders and Members. Data is shown in Figure 1 below. The figure (1) shows Members generated a higher number of rides than Casuals, especially on weekdays. And Members had higher usage on weekdays, which may be used for daily commutes to and from work.
However, on weekends, more rides were logged by Casual riders compared to members. This could be because of more visitors visiting the city on weekends. <b> <br/>

2) The data was then analyzed for average ride durations logged by Casual riders and Members. Figure 2.  <br/>

<h2>Top 3 Recommendations</h2>

- <b><p align="center">1) Promote and advertise to Casual Riders that the annual membership provides cheaper rates with longer ride durations for renting electric bikes, especially on the weekends.
<p align="center">2) Promote about the benefits that come with the annual membership, including in-app recommendations for local attractions, discounted prices for entrance fees, at local retailers (cafes, restaurants), and other partnership discount.
<p align="center">2) Promote that the membership can be used in other cities's bike rental program.</p></b>
