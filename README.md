<h1>Google Data Analytics Certificate Case Study: Bike Share Program</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

- For the Google Data Analytics Certificate, I chose Case Study 1 as my Capstone Project. <br />
- In brief, in this project, I was tasked as a "junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. And my team wanted to understand "how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently." From the insights gained from data analysis (including the asking, preparing, collecting, cleaning, processing, analysis, and sharing steps), my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. <br />

- There were three questions that guide the future marketing program, and I was assigned the first question to answer:<br />
<b><p align="center">"How do annual members and riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"</p></b>

- I collected (downloaded) 15 consecutive months of data from a provided database. I used <b>Microsoft Excel</b> for the data preparation and processing steps.</b>

- After preparing, cleaning, and processing, I used <b>R programming</b> to analyze the cleaned data. </b>
</b>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>
